# Animal Crossing New Horizons - Pocket Calculator
The goal of this app was to make a application that will look at add all of the items in your pocket in real time so you know how much money you would make selling at the shop.

### Challanges Faced
- There was no ACNH API at the time when I was working on the project so I had to find prices, names and resources from different websites


## Built With

- Node.js
- Vue.js
- CSS
- Semantic UI

## Project setup

```

npm install
npm run serve

```
